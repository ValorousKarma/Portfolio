# Getting Started with Create React App

If you want to edit this source code for your own site, that's fine!

Make sure you have node.js installed, navigate to the cloned repo, and use:

```npm install```

to install dependencies. Then edit /src/Components/Contact.js to use your own emailjs
template or placeholder values.

Finally use:

```npm start```

to start host the site locally, in development mode.
